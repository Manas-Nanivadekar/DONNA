This is crucial for maintaining system stability and user experience.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n*   Implement robust error handling.\n*   Prioritize immediate detection and resolution of permanent errors.\n*   Document all error handling logic.\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n*   Ignoring permanent errors.\n*   Allowing errors to propagate through the system.\n*   Not having a clear strategy for handling failures.",
