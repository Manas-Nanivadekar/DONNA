Examine Lambda function logs (if any).\n2.  Review DynamoDB query patterns.\n3.  Check Lambda function timeout settings.\n4.  Validate IAM permissions.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n*   Always implement comprehensive logging in Lambda functions.\n*   Regularly review and optimize DynamoDB queries.\n*   Set appropriate Lambda function timeout settings.\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n*   Lack of logging in Lambda functions.\n*   Inefficient DynamoDB queries.\n*   Ignoring Lambda timeout settings.",
