The goal is to provide a stable and predictable scaling experience.  \n\n**Key Considerations:**\n* **Kubernetes HPA:**  Adjust HPA settings to include a 60-second cooldown period.  This will prevent the system from rapidly scaling up during peak demand.\n* **Deployment Scripts:** Add cooldown periods to deployment scripts to ensure that new instances are not immediately available after a scaling event.\n* **Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive monitoring to track scaling events and resource utilization.",
