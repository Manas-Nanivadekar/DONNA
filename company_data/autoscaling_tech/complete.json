Here are key best practices to mitigate performance issues:\n\n*   **Database Optimization:** Optimize database queries, use indexes, and consider read replicas.\n*   **Caching:** Implement caching layers (Redis, Memcached) for frequently accessed data.\n*   **Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number of requests from a single user or IP address.\n*   **Monitoring:**  Implement robust monitoring to detect performance anomalies in real-time.\n\n## Common Mistakes:\n*   Ignoring database query performance.  This is a common root cause.\n*   Lack of proper caching strategy.  Results in unnecessary database load.\n*   Not scaling infrastructure appropriately for peak load.",
